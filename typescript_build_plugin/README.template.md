grandMA3/gma3_library/datapools/plugins/{{author}}
```

And Paste it in USB drive under the `plugins` folder, as such:

```
grandMA3/gma3_library/datapools/plugins/{{author}}
```

>NOTE: Do NOT put the plugin's XML and LUA files directly in the `plugins` folder. They must be under: `plugins/{{author}}/{{pluginName}} - {{versionSuffix}}/MA3 1.x`

### Copy The Files To Your MA3 Plugin Library (Internal Drive)

Inside the provided `grandMA3` you can find the `{{author}}` folder, here:

`grandMA3/gma3_library/datapools/plugins/{{author}}`

#### on Mac

`/Users/[your user]/MALightingTechnology/gma3_library/datapools/plugins/{{author}}`


>If a {{author}} folder already exists, then choose "Merge"

## Part 3 - Install/Update

The plugin installation is per show file.

### Install

If you've never installed this plugin in your showfile:

- Click the imported plugin object
- Choose "Install"

### Version Update

If you already installed some older version in your show file:

- Click the new version's plugin object
- Choose "Install"
- Choose "IMPORT"
- Click the old version's plugin object
- Choose "Uninstall"

## Part 4 - Uninstall Previous Version

Different versions of Pro Plugins do not interfere with one another, they also don't share their data nor their generated assets (pool objects).
In case the plugin supports data migration from old versions, it will prompt you for it upon installation.

To uninstall the previous version, click on the plugin object (In the plugin pool) and choose "Uninstall". This will remove all assets generated by the plugin.
